### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ I'm a developer and recent graduate with experience in both frontend and backend. I have worked on a variety of projects, which I'm working to showcase on GitHub, from both ground up and in collaboration with other developers and stakeholders from the university. I love solving problems with code and I'm excited to start on more new projects! âœ¨
